## Abstract:

It is difficult to find all the basic information about many companies or startups at one place. This includes the firm's founder, projects completed in the past and the projects they are currently workings on, the job status, recuruitment processes, stocks, etc. The Problem of visiting very every company's website differently or referring multiple sites for correct information required can be solved using data scraping(web scraping). This project creates a platform for combining all these features into one. 


Data Scraping/ Web Scraping

Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. Itâ€™s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website.
